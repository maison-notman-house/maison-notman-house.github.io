# Hack the House

## Particle Photon

- We attached a couple of sensors to a photon to detect motion/changes
- Firmware to do this can be found in `led_motion_sensor.ino`
- Documentation is at [docs.particle.io](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/intro/photon/)
- Firmware can be flashed to the photon via the particle web IDE at [build.photon.io](https://build.particle.io/)
- Photon can be claimed, setup, or have its wifi configured with the [particle cli](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli)
